Making the code more visible should be the best thing I  do
## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
...
Of course, I think there are still many deficiencies in the current code
## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
...
Using Kivy to create simulators makes it possible to operate, and using custom functions to create function ontologies

... 
The first major challenge is to keep writing a little every day, otherwise it will not be finished in the end. 
The second challenge is whether I can't write or don't know what to write when writing code. I will choose to check 
the previous learning materials and homework, or search Google for how to write it
## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
...
Using the class statement, you can call other written functions more flexibly, which is more simple and concise
